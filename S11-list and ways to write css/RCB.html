    <p>
      Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB), officially known as Royal Challengers
      Bengaluru, are a professional cricket franchise based in Bangalore,
      Karnataka, competing in the Indian Premier League (IPL). Founded in 2008
      by United Spirits, the team is named after the company's liquor brand,
      Royal Challenge. The M. Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bangalore serves as their
      home ground. Royal Challengers have finished as runners-up on three
      occasions in 2009, 2011, and 2016, and have qualified for the playoffs in
      nine out of seventeen seasons. The franchise has also competed in the
      Champions League Twenty20, finishing as runners-up in the 2011 season. RCB
      is valued at $69.8 million, making them one of the most valuable IPL
      franchises. As of 2024, the team is captained by Faf du Plessis and
      coached by Andy Flower. Royal Challengers Bangalore also hold two
      important IPL records, for the lowest total score made in an innings (49,
      against Kolkata Knight Riders) and for the highest total score conceded in
      an innings (287, against Sunrisers Hyderabad).

    <h1>History</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
      In September 2007, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI)
      announced the establishment of the Indian Premier League (IPL), a Twenty20
      competition set to begin in 2008.On 24 January 2008, an auction was
      held in Mumbai for the league's teams, which represented eight different
      cities in India, including Bangalore. The Bangalore franchise was acquired
      by Vijay Mallya for US$111.6 million, making it the second-highest bid,
      slightly less than Reliance Industries' US$111.9 million bid for the
      Mumbai Indians.Rahul Dravid was the team's icon player in 2008. Ahead
      of the 2008 player auction, the IPL designated Rahul Dravid as the icon
      player for the Bangalore franchise. This designation ensured that Dravid
      would be paid 15% more than the highest bid player at the auction.The
      franchise acquired several prominent Indian and international players,
      including Jacques Kallis, Anil Kumble, Zaheer Khan, Mark Boucher, Dale
      Steyn, and Cameron White.In the second round of the auction, they also
      signed Ross Taylor, Misbah-ul-Haq, and India under-19 World Cup-winning
      captain Virat Kohli.The franchise named Dravid as the captain of the
      team and appointed Venkatesh Prasad as the head coach.The team
      struggled in the inaugural season, winning only four out of their 14
      matches and finishing seventh in the eight-team table.Dravid was the
      sole player to score more than 300 runs in the tournament, and the team
      even had to bench their most expensive foreign player, Kallis, for several
      matches due to his poor form.Midway through the season, the
      string of failures led to the sacking of CEO Charu Sharma, who was
      replaced by Brijesh Patel. Mallya publicly criticized Dravid and Sharma
      for their selection of players at the auction, stating that his "biggest
      mistake was to abstain from the selection of the team."Eventually,
      the chief cricketing officer of the franchise, Martin Crowe, resigned and
      Prasad was replaced by Ray Jennings as the head coach.

      At the 2009 player auction, the franchise signed Kevin Pietersen for a
      record US$1.55 million, making him the most expensive player alongside
      Andrew Flintoff (Chennai Super Kings).They also traded Zaheer Khan
      for Robin Uthappa with the Mumbai Indians and brought in local batsman
      Manish Pandey.Due to general elections in India, the tournament
      was held in South Africa.Pietersen was named captain, but after a
      string of initial losses, Anil Kumble took over the captaincy when
      Pietersen left for national duty.RCB's performance improved under
      Kumble, winning six of their last eight matches to finish third in the
      league table.They defeated Chennai Super Kings in the semi-final but
      fell short by six runs in the final against Deccan Chargers.In 2010, the
      Royal Challengers, under Kumble's captaincy, secured seven wins from 14
      matches, accumulating 14 points. Tied with three other teams for a playoff
      spot, their superior net run rate qualified them for the semi-finals.
      In the semi-final, they were defeated by the table-toppers, the Mumbai
      Indians, by 35 runs.However, the Royal Challengers secured a
      convincing nine-wicket win over the defending champions, the Deccan
      Chargers, in the third-place playoff, thus qualifying for the 2010
      Champions League Twenty20.Kumble retired at the conclusion of the
      Champions League, having led the team to the semi-finals of both the IPL
      and the CLT20 that year.
