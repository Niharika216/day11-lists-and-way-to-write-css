      based in Chennai, Tamil Nadu. The team competes in the Indian Premier
      League (IPL) and was one of the eight franchises incorporated when the
      league was established in 2008. The team plays its home matches at the M.

      have appeared in a record 10 finals and qualified for the playoff stages
      12 times out of the 15 seasons they have played, more than any other team.

      The team was suspended for two years from the IPL starting July 2015 due
      to the involvement of its owners in the 2013 IPL betting case. Super Kings
      re-joined IPL for the 2018 season and won the title in its comeback
      season. The team has a significant fan following. In January 2022, CSK
      became India's first unicorn sports enterprise. As of 2022, it was the
      second most valuable IPL franchise with a valuation of $1.15 billion.
