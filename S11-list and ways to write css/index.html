        The Indian Premier League (IPL), also known as the TATA IPL for
        sponsorship reasons, is a men's Twenty20 (T20) cricket league held
        annually in India. Founded by the BCCI (the Board of Control for Cricket
        in India) in 2007, the league features ten state or city-based franchise
        teams.The IPL usually takes place during the summer, between March and
        May each year. It has an exclusive window in the ICC Future Tours
        Programme, resulting in fewer international cricket tours occurring
        during the IPL seasons.
        <br />
        The IPL is by far the most popular cricket league in the world; in 2014,
        it ranked sixth in average attendance among all sports leagues.In 2010,
        the IPL became the first sporting event to be broadcast live on
        YouTube.Inspired by the success of the IPL, other Indian sports leagues
        have been established.In 2022, the league's brand value was estimated at
        ₹90,038 crore (US$11 billion). According to the BCCI, the 2015 IPL
        season contributed ₹1,150 crore (US$140 million) to India's GDP.In
        December 2022, the IPL achieved a valuation of US$10.9 billion, becoming
        a decacorn and registering a 75% growth in dollar terms since 2020 when
        it was valued at $6.2 billion, according to a report by the consulting
        firm D and P Advisory.Its 2023 final became the most streamed live event
        on the internet, with 32 million viewers.
        <br />
        In 2023, the league sold its media rights for the next 4 seasons for
        US$6.4 billion to Viacom18 and Star Sports,meaning each IPL match was
        valued at $13.4 million.As of 2024, there have been seventeen seasons of
        the tournament. The current champions are the Kolkata Knight Riders, who
        won the 2024 season after defeating the Sunrisers Hyderabad in the
        final.

      <h2>History</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>
        <b style="font-size: 1.3rem">Inspired by a rival</b>
        <br />
        In 2007, Zee Entertainment Enterprises founded the Indian Cricket League
        (ICL).The ICL was not recognized by the Board of Control for Cricket in
        India (BCCI) or the International Cricket Council (ICC). Moreover, the
        BCCI was unhappy about its committee members joining the ICL executive
        board.In response, the BCCI increased the prize money for its domestic
        tournaments and imposed lifetime bans on players who joined the rival
        league, which it considered a rebel league.
        <br />
        <b style="font-size: 1.3rem">Foundation</b>
        <br />
        On 13 September 2007,following India's victory at the 2007 T20 World
        Cup,the BCCI announced a franchise based Twenty20 cricket competition
        known as the Indian Premier League. The inaugural season was scheduled
        to start in April 2008, commencing with a "high-profile ceremony" in New
        Delhi. BCCI Vice-president Lalit Modi, who led the IPL initiative,
        provided details of the tournament, including its format, prize money,
        franchise revenue system, and squad composition rules. The league, to be
        managed by a seven-man governing council, would also serve as the
        qualifying mechanism for that year's Champions League Twenty20.
      </p>

    <p>
      To determine team ownership, an auction for the franchises was held on 24
      January 2008. The reserve prices for the eight franchises totalled $400
      million,[24] but the auction ultimately raised $723.59 million.[27] The
      league officially commenced in April 2008, featuring Chennai Super Kings
      (CSK), Mumbai Indians (MI), Delhi Daredevils (DD), Kings XI Punjab (KXIP),
      Deccan Chargers (DC), Rajasthan Royals (RR), Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR),
      and Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB).[28] Following the ban on players
      who chose to participate in the ICL, the rival league shut down in 2009.
